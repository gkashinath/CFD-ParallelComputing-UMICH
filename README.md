# Parallel Computing and Computational Fluid Dynamics

This folder contains 6 sample projects from my Masters program in Aerospace Engineering from University of Michigan, Ann Arbor.

- **00-FlowScience-Interview:** Presentation summarizing the three main projects I worked on during my MS program.
- **01-Parallel-Compressible-Navier-Stokes-Solver:** This work was part of my independent study at which involved developing a parallel compressible Navier-Stokes solver used to study Shock-Boundary Layer Interaction flow.
- **02-Parallelizing-KIVA-Engine-Code-Module:** This work was part of the Parallel Computing course taken in the computer science dept. at UMICH where I parallelized a module of an engine code called [KIVA] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KIVA_(software)). 
- **03-Lid-Driven-Cavity-Flow:** This project contains a summary of the development of an incompressible flow simulator as part of the CFD Masters class project.
- **04-2D-Euler-Solver:** This project contains a report summarizing the develoment work of a 2D-Euler equation solver applied to a simulate a shock wave around a blunt body.
- **05-FVM-Airfoil-Unstructured:** This project involved the development of a MATLAB code to simulate the flow around an airfoil.
- **06-Channel-Flow-Optimization:** This project summarizes the development of a code used to optimize the flow in a 2D channel.

**Programming skills:** FORTRAN, MPI, OpenMP and MATLAB
